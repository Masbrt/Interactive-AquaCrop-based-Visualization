Participatory Modeling Framework: Climate Resilient Rice Farming

This project is an interactive simulation tool built with React.js and Plotly to visualize the impacts of future rainfall variability on rice growth using an AquaCrop-inspired approach.
It integrates:

Rainfall heatmaps across future decades (2020â€“2049) under different sowing dates.

AquaCrop-style growth simulations (transpiration, canopy cover, and soil moisture).

Dynamic yield tables that update progressively during the simulation, highlighting the best sowing strategy under climate change scenarios.

The tool demonstrates how participatory modeling can help farmers and researchers co-design resilient farming practices under uncertain rainfall patterns.
